Anti-circumvention investigation aligns with China's legal provisions and WTO rules, and aims to maintain the authority and effectiveness of current trade remedy measures, an official from the Trade Remedy and Investigation Bureau of Chinese Commerce Ministry (MOFCOM) said on Thursday, as China ruled that US optical fiber exporters circumvented the country's anti-dumping measures and started to impose anti-dumping tariffs on the same day.

After receiving an application from a domestic firm, MOFCOM announced on March 4, 2025 that it would  launch an anti-circumvention investigation into certain optical fiber products imported from the US -the first such case in China - and, according to the findings of the investigation, decided to impose anti-circumvention measures starting from Thursday, the official said, according to a statement on the ministry's website.

"The initiation of this investigation aligns with China's legal provisions and WTO rules. It is intended to maintain  the authority and effectiveness ofcurrent trade remedy measures," the official said.

According to the Foreign Trade Law, the MOFCOM has the right to initiate investigations into acts circumventing foreign trade remedy measures and adopt necessary anti-circumvention measures.

On July 30, 2025,  MOFCOM released draft rules on anti-circumvention investigation in trade remedy measures to solicit public opinion. With the consultation period now concluded, MOFCOM will further enrich and improve China's trade remedy investigation system in practice, according to the official.

"China has always been prudent and restrained in implementing trade remedy measures, and remains committed to safeguarding fairness and free trade. At the same time, we will take necessary steps to ensure the effectiveness of existing trade remedy measures and protect the legitimate rights and interests of domestic industries," the official stressed.
