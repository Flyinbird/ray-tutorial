When asked to comment on US President Donald Trump's claim about the Chinese, Russian and North Korean leaders conspiring against the US on the occasion of China's V-day celebrations, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said on Thursday that China's development of diplomatic relations with any country has never been targeted at any third party. 

China invited foreign guests to attend the events in Beijing to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War, Guo said. 

The purpose was to join peace-loving countries and peoples in remembering history, honoring those who sacrificed their lives, cherishing peace, and looking to the future, the spokesperson noted. 

As a grand commemorative meeting started in Beijing's Tian'anmen Square on Wednesday morning to mark the 80th anniversary of the victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War, Trump said in a social media post that he hopes the Chinese president and the wonderful Chinese people have a great and lasting day of celebration. 

Media reported that in Trump's post, he also extends his "warmest regards" to Russian and North Korean leaders as "you conspire against The United States of America."

"The US president is not without a sense of humor," Putin said in Beijing during a press conference on Wednesday. When asked to comment on Trump's comments, Putin said none of the world leaders who joined the summit in China "expressed negative judgments about the current US administration," CNN reported.
